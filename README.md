# Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository dedicated to exploring the advancements in skin cancer detection through the lens of deep learning techniques. This repository houses a comprehensive systematic literature review that delves into the application of neural networks for the early detection of skin cancer.

## Research Focus
The primary focus of this research is to analyze the efficacy of various deep learning models, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs), and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs), in the realm of skin cancer detection. By examining the nuances of these models, we aim to shed light on the optimal approaches for accurate and timely diagnosis.

## Key Insights
Through meticulous analysis, our study has uncovered crucial insights:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrate unparalleled performance in classifying lesion images for skin cancer detection.
- The emphasis in existing literature predominantly revolves around binary classification of cancerous versus non-cancerous lesions, rather than specific skin cancer subtypes.
- There exists a substantial opportunity for refining current diagnostic methodologies in the domain of skin cancer detection.

## Methodological Rigor
Our research methodology adhered to stringent criteria, encompassing rigorous selection of relevant literature, meticulous abstract screening, and thorough quality assessment of selected studies. The systematic literature review was meticulously conducted to categorize and evaluate the best practices in employing neural networks for skin cancer detection.
